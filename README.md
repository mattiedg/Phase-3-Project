## Business Probelem

### The goal of our data analysis here will be to ascertain customers of SyriaTel that are the most likely to 'churn'.  To do this we will take a look at data for customers that includes information such as how many calls they have made, how long they have held an account with the company, as well as numerous fields related to the number of calls made per customer per day. We will analyze the relationship between these fields and whether or not the customer left the company with the aim of being able to target customers who are at risk of churn to attempt to keep their business.

### To begin we should take a closer look at what exactly customer churn means. The churn rate, also known as the rate of attrition or customer churn, is the rate at which customers stop doing business with an entity. Churn can further be classified into two subsections. One of these is customers who no longer require the services of the company becuase they are moving, deceased, or any other cause that is not variable to personal carrier preference. The second, and the churn we shall primarily be concerned with here, are customer who have the option to retain the services of a company but instead choose to cancel their contract and move to a competitor in the same industry.  With the second type of churn there is the option that the customer can be persuaded or incentivized to stay with the company.
